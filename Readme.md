# Android Wireless Debug Script
`Adbconnect` is a shell script, which simplifies annoying `adb` remote debug configuration. Instead of finding the devices ip address and typing bunch of junk command, you can just run `adbconnect.sh`.

##Requirements
Since, this is a shell script, it requires unix based OS, e.g., OSX, Linux.

##Usage
- Plug your device to your computer via USB
- Run the script
- Unplug your device
- Ready for wireless debuging
